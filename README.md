##SFDI REST API PROJECT

 This Project directory is broken down into two directories. One for Backend app (REST-API) and One for the Frontend app(Mobile-App/mobile)

###1.) The REST-API app

- This app is started by running ```nodemon``` which which will launch the app on ```localhost:5000```
- From here when opening up the the backend app there is a simplistic user interface that allows for entries to be added in through basic input boxes
